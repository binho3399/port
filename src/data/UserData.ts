export const aboutMe =
    `I'm a UX/UI Designer with 4 years of experience, currently based in Ho Chi Minh City. Since 2023, I've been working as a Project Manager at SuZu Group.

    I'm passionate about crafting user experiences that are both enjoyable and meaningful. By blending functionality, aesthetics, and user-centered thinking, I help transform ideas into innovative, business-driven products.

    I have a solid understanding of design principles and know how to apply them effectively across various projects—from web and mobile applications to branding and marketing materials. Over the years, I've led design teams, collaborated with cross-functional departments, and conducted user research to guide design decisions.

    Alongside my product design expertise, I've also developed strong team management skills. I'm always exploring new technologies and sustainable design approaches to stay ahead in the field and continuously improve the user experience.`;
